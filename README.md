# Word-vector-segmentation-of-text
This is a method of segmenting the word vector of the txt text. Before the segmentation, you should perform some data cleaning on the text to ensure that the text after segmentation is highly effective.
 The code simply replaces the extra blank lines in the text data (or more than one space with an empty string), pre-processing the text into data without spaces. Then divide the word and word by the method of`.join().`
